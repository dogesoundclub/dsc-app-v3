                Mutant Ape Yacht Club is a collection of digital artworks (NFTs) running on the Ethereum network. This website is only an interface allowing participants to purchase digital collectibles. Users are entirely responsible for the safety and management of their own private Ethereum wallets and validating all transactions and contracts generated by this website before approval. Furthermore, as the Mutant Ape Yacht Club smart contract runs on the Ethereum network, there is no ability to undo, reverse, or restore any transactions.
                
                This website and its connected services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranty of any kind. By using this website you are accepting sole responsibility for any and all transactions involving Mutant Ape Yacht Club digital collectibles.

                A. You Own the NFT. Each Mutant Ape is an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. When you purchase an NFT, you own the underlying Mutant Ape, the Art, completely. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely by the Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network: at no point may we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any Mutant Ape.

                B. Personal Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Yuga Labs LLC grants you a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art, along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your Mutant Ape / NFT, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Mutant Ape owner’s rights to display the Art for their Mutant Ape to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your Mutant Ape, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each Mutant Ape owner’s rights to display the Art for their Mutant Ape to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Mutant Ape leaves the website/application.

                C. Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Yuga Labs LLC grants you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Art (“Commercial Use”). Examples of such Commercial Use would e.g. be the use of the Art to produce and sell merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies of the Art. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of Mutant Apes generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Mutant Ape owner’s rights to display the Art for their Mutant Ape to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of Mutant Apes generally, provided that the third party website or application cryptographically verifies each Mutant Ape owner’s rights to display the Art for their Mutant Ape to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased Mutant Ape leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing.

                D. MAYC/BAYC IP.  Other than the rights to the Art, nothing herein gives you any rights to any other trademarks or other intellectual property rights belonging to Yuga Labs including, without limitation, to Bored Ape Yacht Club, BAYC, Bored Ape Kennel Club, BAKC, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, MAYC, and the associated logos. All of these rights are expressly reserved in the name of Yuga Labs LLC.

                A. If you elect to purchase a Mutant Ape through the Site, any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions.  We will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage or any other transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum network.

                B. Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction.

                You accept and acknowledge each of the following:

                A. To the extent that you sell your Mutant Ape NFT, please be aware that the prices of NFTs are extremely volatile and fluctuations in the prices of other NFTs and impact the price of your Mutant Ape both positively and negatively.  Given the volatility, NFTs such as Mutant Ape should not be considered an investment. You assume all risks in that connection.

                B. Ownership of a Mutant Ape confers ownership of digital artwork only. Accordingly, no information on this Site (or any other documents mentioned therein) is or may be considered to be advice or an invitation to enter into an agreement for any investment purpose. Further, nothing on this Site qualifies or is intended to be an offering of securities in any jurisdiction nor does it constitute an offer or an invitation to purchase shares, securities or other financial products.  Due to the artistic nature of the project, MAYC has not been registered with or approved by any regulator in any jurisdiction. It remains your sole responsibility to assure that the purchase of the Mutant Ape and the associated art is in compliance with laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.

                C. You assume all risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet.

                D. NFTs, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are relatively new and the regulatory landscape is unsettled.  New regulations could negatively impact such technologies impacting the value for your Mutant Ape. You understand and accept all risk in that regard.

                E. You assume all responsibility for any adverse effects of disruptions or other issues impacting Ethereum or the Ethereum platform.
