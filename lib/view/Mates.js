                    1 is the sha256 hash of the original dscmates.png(shown above) containing all 10, 000 mates.This is a value that can only be obtained when the original file is converted to sha256.If the hash value for the file does not come out, it is not an authentic copy. (Try to generate the hash of the above figure through "openssl dgst -sha256 dscmates.png" in Linux.) If there are multiple contracts with this hash value due to reckless duplication, the first one created among them is the original.You only need to trade the tokens contained in this contract.
